Never the master, always the student. This blog is focused on learning new technology in the cloud space, specifically with AWS. It's an entirely [serverless blog](https://greengocloud.com/2018/08/28/How-to-Make-a-Fast-and-Cheap-Serverless-Blog/) and my plan is to cover areas like serverless, containers, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and configuration management. Each of the categories are very different but serve an important purpose in the IT world.

My journey started when I signed up for the US Air Force at 18 years old. I took the first job that was leaving which turned out to be in IT. I thought the Air Force was going to be a 20 year career. Life isn't what you expect sometimes and I was thrusted back in the civilian wilderness after 6 successful years of active duty. Luckily, the Air Force equipped me with a skill to apply in the real world and I've been able to continue my service as an Air Force Reservist.

As a civilian, I started at help desk support (like most IT folks) and quickly found that I needed to do something more challenging. I moved on to be a Network Engineer and soon after began managing entire IT infrastructure for MSP clients. It was a great experience but the on-call emergencies/weekend upgrades weren't fun. Finally, I found Amazon Web Services (AWS) and it really changed my career. I immediately got AWS certified which opened the door to cloud projects and I've been building cloud solutions ever since. As a Cloud Architect, I'm expected to have a broad knowledge on a number of services and that's what I plan to capture in this blog.

Outside of technology, I'm married to my beautiful wife Steph, we have a dog named Blue and I also enjoy playing golf.
