Hi! I'm Blake Green. I've created this site to post about new technology and things I've learned throughout my career.

My journey started when I signed up for the US Air Force when I was 18 years old. I thought the Air Force was going to be my 20 year career. Life isn't what you expect sometimes and I was thrusted back in the civilian wilderness after 6 years of active duty. Luckily, I've been able to continue my service as an Air Force Reservist but that is one weekend each month. I needed to find a full time gig.

Like most IT folks, I started at the bottom doing help desk support. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for those people but I couldn't stick around. I felt like I should be doing something else. Something more challenging than resetting passwords in Active Directory. I wanted to use my mind to solve problems. There wasn't any thinking involved at the help desk.

I was given an opportunity to be a Network Engineer. I took advantage (mainly because I didn't want to go back to the help desk) and I quickly learned new skills. Before I knew it, I was standing up and managing entire infrastructure for MSP clients. But the on-call emergencies and the late night/weekend upgrades were really taking a toll. I began to rethink my career decision. 

Finally, I was exposed to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and suddenly felt a sense of rejuvenation in my career. I was captivated by the services and couldn't wait to start building things. I became obsessed in coming up with complex solutions built from scratch. More importantly, I could automate everything and didn't need to be around for late night/weekend upgrades. I got AWS certified and that opened the door to cloud projects. As a Cloud Architect, I'm expected to have a broad knowledge on a number of services and that's what I plan to capture in this blog.

Outside of technology, I'm married to my beautiful wife Steph, we have a dog named Blue and I also enjoy playing golf.
