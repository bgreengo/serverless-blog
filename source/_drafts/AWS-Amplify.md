I still remember the first time I deployed a Wordpress website on an EC2 instance. It was my first introduction to AWS and I was immediately hooked. It took a few clicks in the AWS console and all the sudden I had this cloud server to run my website. Except, this server was my responsibility and in order to keep it secure, I was required to maintain it.
