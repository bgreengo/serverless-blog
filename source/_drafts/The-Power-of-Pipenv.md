I found out the hard way, but Python virtual environments are super important. Before I found Pipenv, I was pip installing all sorts of 3rd party packages on my computer and began to see a number of conflicts. I was so far in a hole that I didn't know what was installed and forced me to completely wipe my computer and start over (it was also time anyway).
