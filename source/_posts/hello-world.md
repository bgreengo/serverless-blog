Never the master, always the student. This blog is focused on learning new technology in the cloud space, specifically with AWS. It's an entirely serverless blog (which will probably be a blog post topic) and my plan is to cover areas like serverless, containers, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and configuration management. Each of the categories are very different but serve an important purpose in the IT world.
