# Welcome to the GreengoTech Blog

I believe in failing fast, not for the sake of wasting time, but for the sake of gaining more information than what I had before. Failing without learning is just failure, but failing with pride, excitement, and a hunger to learn more is the seed to success.

I've accepted the fact that I'm going to be learning for the rest of my life, so this blog is focused on learning new technology in the cloud space, specifically with AWS. I plan to capture everything from serverless to containers. Heck, even serverless containers! 

Please reach out to me directly @ greengotechnet@gmail.com or in the social media links to the right!
