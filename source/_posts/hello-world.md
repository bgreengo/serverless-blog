I've come to the realization that I'm going to be learning for the rest of my life. Along the way, I will fail. The challenge is not overcoming failure but treating every failure as an opportunity to get better. I appreciate the military for teaching me to be resilient and being able to bounce back. I also admire legends in the IT world, like Kelsey Hightower, who support this perspective:

It's the mistakes that make it perfect.

Never the master, always the student. This blog is focused on learning (and sometimes failing) new technology in the cloud space, specifically with AWS. I'd also like to mention that this blog is entirely serverless on AWS, which will likely be a blog post topic.
