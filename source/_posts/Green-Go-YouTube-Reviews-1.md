{% youtube oNa3xK2GFKY %}

I think it's only fitting that my first YouTube review is a keynote from Kelsey Hightower. A Developer Advocate at Google, Kelsey always delivers creative and inspiring talks. I found out about Kelsey when I started to learn about Kubernetes. Kelsey was a large supporter of Kubernetes and created [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) to help people deep dive into the technology. These days, Kelsey seems to have opened his mind to alternative solutions to solve problems. He doesn't pick a side in the war between serverless and containers/Kubernetes. Instead, he takes from both to get results.

I enjoyed this particular talk because Kelsey blends the old with the new. You realize that you don't always need a new solution to solve a new problem. He makes it look easy and seamless while also being relatable and motivating. Also, how cool is that to have music play in your CLI? Always entertaining and I encourage you to check out all of his talks.
