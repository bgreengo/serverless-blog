# Intro
I completed my [5th AWS certification!](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/transcript.aspx?transcript=YQ40S242KN141DS9) While certifications are no substitute for experience, these certifications have changed my career. I've been able to gain experience through obtaining AWS certifications and continued to grow as a professional. I believe that passing these AWS certifications has provided me with credibility and validation of the skills I've gained through learning new services and applying them to cloud solutions. 

# Exam Prep
For each certification, I used the same strategy. I watched each certification specific course from A Cloud Guru and Linux Academy. After completing the courses, I reviewed Jayendra's blog for notes and then watched re:Invent videos. Some people have created YouTube playlists for specific exams which is very helpful.

#  AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate

{% asset_img sa-a-req.png %}

I remember this exam covering a lot of different AWS services. It was my first AWS exam and I was a bit overwhelmed with the AWS lingo. I can't recommend A Cloud Guru enough for this certification. I think the instructor, Ryan Kroonenburg, does an excellent job with explaining foundational concepts that I still use today. I will never forget the fault tolerant Wordpress section because that lesson really opened my eyes at the capabilities that AWS can provide. I thought it was the coolest thing to have a site running in the Australia region. 

After passing this certification, I was hooked! I didn't play Pokemon but I felt the need to "Catch 'Em All"!

Key Areas:
- EC2
- VPC
- IAM

#  AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate

With my SysAdmin backgroud, I thought this certification was my next logical choice. I made it a goal to complete before the 2017 re:Invent conference. I had over a year under my belt since my last certification and it made a huge difference. I was familiar with the AWS platform by this time and working in the AWS console daily. 

Key Areas:
- Elastic Load Balancer
- CloudWatch
- IAM

#  AWS Certified Developer - Associate

I took the exam before they updated it in 2018. Prior to sitting the exam, I assumed the exam was more focused on the developer services  which turned out not to be the case. By this time, I was extremely confident in my AWS skills and it showed on this particular exam. There wasn't very much depth to the questions and with my knowledge of the services, it was extremely simple to pinpoint the answer (probably the reason they updated the exam).

Key areas:
- DynamoDB
- S3
- SQS
- IAM

#  AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional

{% asset_img sa-pro-req.png %}

My **Solutions Architect - Associate** was going to expire. Instead of retaking SA-A, I used the 50% off voucher that AWS provides and went for the **Solutions Architect - Professional**. This was by far the toughest exam I've ever taken at the time but also a big accomplishment for me. I was very proud to earn this certification, level up into the "Professional" ranks, and recertify my **Solutions Architect - Associate** certification. The accumulation of all three associate level certification definitely helped since this exam covers such a wide variety of AWS services. Not only were the questions long and difficult, my testing terminal froze halfway through my exam. Luckily, they testing folks were able to refresh it and I didn't have to start over but the added stress didn't help. The exam is truly a race against time. 

Key areas:
- Hybrid Architectures (on-premises and cloud)
  - Direct Connect
  - VPN
- IAM

# AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional

{% asset_img devops-req.png %}

I thought the **Solution Architect - Professional** was hard but the **DevOps Engineer - Professional** takes the cake. Perhaps it had to do with my lack of experience with OpsWorks and Elastic Beanstalk but it was very challenging. There is a reason these two exams are "Professional" level because they certainly are not a walk in the park. My testing terminal froze again during this exam but I'm starting to think that is good luck. This exam was 80 questions and 170 minutes long. I used every single second. I had to dig deep and use process of elimination to zone in on the correct answer. I was very happy to pass this exam and recertify the **SysOps - Associate** and **Developer - Associate** in the process. 

Key areas:
- CloudFormation
- OpsWorks
- Elastic Beanstalk
- Auto Scaling
- Deployment options

#  What's Next?

I always say I will take a break from certifications but that never happens. I might go for one of the AWS Specialty certifications like Big Data or Networking. Who knows... AWS might come out with a **Serverless certification** in the near future. That would be pretty cool.
