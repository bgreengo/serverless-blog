I have accepted the fact that I'm going to spend the rest of my life **learning**. I've come to terms with myself that if I want to be successful, I must be incapable of being content. There is such a massive amount of information at our fingertips, it can be overwhelming to find useful and applicable material to help you learn. I've assembled a list of folks that have made me a more valuable professional because I follow them. *NOTE:* There is a ton of other people that I've missed and should be on this list but when you start to follow these leaders, you'll see the other turn up.

To be a great leader, you must first learn to follow.

# Platforms
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) - I was late to the Twitter game but I quickly found out that there is a ton of exceptional information that floats around the Twittersphere. I highly recommend creating a Twitter account and start by following some smart people below.
- [Medium](https://medium.com/) - When folks can't fit their thoughts in a few Tweets, Medium provides a place to post detailed blogs. If you sign up for an account, you'll be able to bookmark and comment on interesting posts. I've found some handy how-to's on Medium and a lot of leaders use it so they don't have the hassle of running their own blog. I think it's also easier to reach a larger audience.
- [DEV](https://dev.to/) - Similar to Medium where you post a blog article, DEV is more focused on developer discussions. Create an account and add tags to follow such as #aws.
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/) - I've seen a lot of great stuff here. Especially from folks that are in the weeds with AWS services on a daily basis. It gives you a chance to view what other people are encountering and learn from what other people have to say or chime in yourself.  
- **Newsletters** - A lot of thought leaders and companies are using newsletters to stay in touch with people. It's more of a direct communication so you don't have to go looking for information, it's sitting in your inbox!

# Follow the Leaders
- **Jeff Barr** - If you want to stay up-to-date on anything happening in AWS, you must follow Jeff @jeffbarr on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffbarr). Jeff is the Chief Evangelist at AWS and usually the source of any new posts or updates coming out of AWS.
- **Kelsey Hightower** - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) - Kelsey might be the most inspirational person I've followed and learned from. If you haven't seen one of his many talks at various tech conferences, you are truly missing out. Kelsey comes from the sysadmin side and has been on the leading edge of containers and specifically Kubernetes. He has a lot of memorable quotes but my favorite came from a podcast he did with Cloudbees where he said, "As you age, you grow, the world around you changes and those that pay attention to that change, they adapt to the world around them and they can be successful." Maybe it was the context of what he was explaining but his words continue to resonate with me and I keep driving to be successful. 
- **Abby Fuller** - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abbyfuller) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@abbyfuller) - Abby is an AWS Technical Evangelist and is always posting awesome content on container and other AWS services. Highly recommend her 2017 re:Invent session: [Getting Started with Docker on AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUzsYt3Bj08).
- **Corey Quinn** - Known for his snark, Corey aka @QuinnyPig on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig), has put a twist on learning AWS for me. He constantly pokes fun at AWS but has such an underlying appreciation that is really refreshing. His podcast on iTunes is called Screaming in the Cloud and it's a must listen for those interested in keeping up with the cloud in general. He covers a lot of different topics that are really useful and insightful. I think I like it so much because I can relate to his curiousity of all these new things that keep evolving around cloud technology nowadays.
- **Chris Munns** - @chrismunns on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrismunns) - Chris is a developer advocate and is focused on Serverless. He has a bunch of great talks on Serverless and often posts great info on Twitter.
- **Jeremy Daly** - [Website](https://www.jeremydaly.com/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly) - Jeremy has made waves in the Serverless movement and has written a lot of useful posts. He has helped me bridge the gap on areas such as serverless microservice architectures. 
- **Kyle Galbraith** - [Newsletter](https://www.kylegalbraith.com/learn-by-doing/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kylegalbraith) - Kyle sends nuggets in his newsletter ranging from cloud, tools and code topics.
